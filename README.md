# HDR file formats

Chris Lomont

Two simple to read/write HDR file formats, the Radiance RGBE format often with  file extension "\*.hdr" or "\*.pic", and the portable float map format with file extension "\*.pfm". These are usable in many places, e.g., FFMPEG for reading/writing HDR videos from/to frames.

Note HDR/PIC is quite lossy  and PFM is lossless.

A nice portable viewer for these formats is https://github.com/Tom94/tev
